# Maxwell: A Smart Metering Solution for Decentralized Energy Systems

Maxwell Smart Meter is a game-changing new technology developed by Switch Electric, built on the power of real-time sensors and web3 technologies to enable complex metering services in decentralized energy systems such as microgrids. In the span of just one minute, a smart meter can collect and analyzes over 3,600 data points from several different sensors, including voltage, current, frequency and power factor. Using this data, the meter is able to calculate a very accurate reading of the energy being produced or consumed by any resource connected to it. 

## Hardware Specifications

Maxwell was designed to work with AC inputs ranging from 50-60 Hz and including voltages between 100–240 volts, making it compatible with both European and US grid standards. The utility meter can have one of two types of circuit boards: the first runs on `STM32G4A1KE` and another uses `ATMEGA328`. If remote control switching is required, AC relays are available and a 16MHz quartz crystal oscillator is used to keeps time. Maxwell is available in variants that can accommodate both single-phase and three-phase systems, each drawing about 0.025 W of power on average. The meter is rated for a maximum ambient temperature of 35°C, and its operating temperature range is -25°C to + 55°C. The circuit board itself measures 153.57mm x 103.91mm in size

## EVM & W3bstream Integration

Maxwell is built on a special infrastructure; W3bstream, that is developed by the IoTeX network. W3bstream provides an open, decentralized protocol that sits between blockchain and smart devices. it offloads computation so data remains secure. It converts real-world data into verifiable cryptographic proofs dApp can use, without spending a lot on gas fees or having control over the user's data. The W3bstream nodes contain a WebAssembly runtime environment for executing application logic that verifies the digital signature of the received data, decodes it, checks its conditions and generates proof-based outputs based on application-specific algorithms. The proof is then fed into our dApp smart contract where it can trigger tokens/NFT incentives. [w3bstream whitepaper](https://docsend.com/view/twtxhbzvisdye2xj)

## Cryptographic Signatures and Zero Knowledge Proofs
To ensure data security, the device can secure its data by digitally signing them with the Secp256k1 elliptical curve algorithm and using SHA256 hash functions. This protects against unauthorized access, tampering, or forgery, ensuring that the data received from Maxwell is both accurate and trustworthy.<br>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52095470/230639899-837d0c97-c09b-419e-ad87-3e07f236675d.png). <br>This scheme can also be used to create decentralized identities (DIDs) for every smart meter. A DID is a decentralized identifier that can be used to represent an entity on a blockchain. They are similar to email addresses, but unlike email addresses, they cannot be taken down or censored. Additionally, zero-knowledge proofs are implemented in the w3bstream node to ensure data privacy. They are based on the zk-SNARKS algorithm, which allows for the creation of a proof that does not reveal any information about what it is proving. This ensures that no one can link your data with other users’ data, nor can they learn any personal information about meter users


## LoRaWAN and Helium Integration
Switch Electric is in the process of bringing Maxwell to Helium's IoT network, which provides LoRaWAN coverage for many devices. Maxwell communicates via this technology and can send data across distances up to 3 km. Integrating Maxwell with Helium's IoT network can enable it to leverage the network's LoRaWAN coverage, which can provide reliable and cost-effective long-range communication capabilities. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where the Maxwell device is located in remote or hard-to-reach areas, or where traditional wireless communication methods may be limited or costly.
