# Maxwell: A Smart Metering Solution for Decentralized Energy Systems

Maxwell Smart Meter is a game-changing new technology developed by Switch Electric, built on the power of real-time sensors and web3 technologies to enable complex metering services in decentralized energy systems such as microgrids. In the span of just one minute, a smart meter can collect and analyzes over 3,600 data points from several different sensors, including voltage, current, frequency and power factor. Using this data, the meter is able to calculate a very accurate reading of the energy being produced or consumed by any resource connected to it. 

# Hardware Specifications

Maxwell was designed to work with AC inputs ranging from 50-60 Hz and including voltages between 100â€“240 volts, making it compatible with both European and US grid standards. The utility meter can have one of two types of circuit boards: the first runs on STM32G4A1KE and another uses ATMEGA328. If remote control switching is required, AC relays are available and a 16MHz quartz crystal oscillator is used to keeps time. Maxwell is available in variants that can accommodate both single-phase and three-phase systems, each drawing about 0.025 W of power on average.

# EVM and W3bstream Integration

Maxwell is built on a special infrastructure, W3bstream that's developed by the IoTeX network. W3bstream provides an open, decentralized protocol that sits between blockchain and smart devices. it offloads computation so data remains secure. It converts real-world data into verifiable cryptographic proofs dApp can use, without spending a lot on gas fees or having control over the user's data
