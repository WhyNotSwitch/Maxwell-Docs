# Maxwell: A Smart Metering Solution for Decentralized Energy Systems

Maxwell is an IoT device designed and built by Switch Electric's engineering team to harness the power of real-time sensors and web3 technologies, enabling complex metering services in decentralized energy systems such as micro-grids. The smart meter collects and aggregates over 3,600 data points per minute across a variety of parameters including energy usage, voltage, frequency, current, and power factor. The Maxwell is also versatile and can be adapted for many other use cases outside of energy distribution and retail.
### Features and Specifications
- Built using w3bstream, an off-chain compute infrastructure that converts real-world data from devices into verifiable, chain agnostic, dApp-ready cryptographic proofs
- Communicates via LoRaWAN technology, capable of sending data across distances of up to 3km
- Secures data by cryptographically signing them using the Secp256k1 elliptical curve digital algorithm with SHA256 message digest
- Designed to work with AC inputs with 50-60 Hz / 100-240V, making it compatible with both European and US grid standards
- Firmware runs on two microcontroller variants: an STM32G4A1KE variant and an ATMEGA328 variant with minor price differences
- Can come with AC relays for remotely controlling metered load, a 16MHz quartz crystal oscillator for keeping time, and only runs on about 0.025 W of power
- Available in variants for single-phase and three-phase systems

### Integration with Helium's IoT Network

Switch Electric is currently working on integrating Maxwell with Helium's IoT network, which provides LoRaWAN coverage for many IoT devices and enables the use of Zero Knowledge Proofs via W3bstream. This integration can enhance Maxwell's functionality and value proposition, offering reliable and secure communication capabilities while meeting the needs of customers with diverse requirements and preferences.
