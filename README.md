# Switch Electric's Smart Meter: Maxwell

Maxwell is an advanced smart meter designed and built by Switch Electric. It harnesses the power of real-time sensors and web3 technologies to execute complex metering services in decentralized energy systems, such as micro-grids. Maxwell is capable of collecting and aggregating over 3,600 data points per minute across a variety of parameters, including energy usage, voltage, frequency, current, and power factor.
### Switch Electric

Switch Electric is a metering service provider that offers multiple technology solutions for pre-paid metering, data management, and communications. Our extensive services include installation, configuration, and customization of your meter hardware and communications system; remote diagnostics/monitoring, and technical support. Our vision is to enable cost-effective decentralized energy supply for all of Africa's 1 Billion people by 2100.
### IoTeX

Maxwell was built using the IoTeX network, a blockchain platform for the Internet of Things (IoT). IoTeX is designed to provide a secure and decentralized infrastructure for IoT devices, enabling them to exchange data and interact with smart contracts on the blockchain.
### w3bstream

Maxwell's infrastructure uses w3bstream, an off-chain compute infrastructure serving as an open, decentralized protocol that sits between the blockchain and smart devices. This protocol converts real-world data from devices into verifiable, chain agnostic, dApp-ready cryptographic proofs. Specifically, the w3bstream nodes verify the digital signature of the received data, decodes the data, checks the conditions and generates the corresponding proof based on developer-supplied algorithms. The proof is then fed into a dApp smart contract triggering tokens/NFT incentives.
### LoRaWAN

Maxwell communicates via LoRaWAN technology, which enables it to send data across distances of up to 3km. LoRaWAN is a low-power, wide-area networking (LPWAN) protocol designed to enable long-range communications for IoT devices. This makes it ideal for use in remote or hard-to-reach locations.
### Digital Signatures

Maxwell secures its data by cryptographically signing them using the Secp256k1 elliptical curve digital algorithm with SHA256 message digest. This algorithm ensures the integrity and authenticity of the data, making it resistant to tampering or forgery.
### Zero Knowledge Proofs

The integration of Maxwell with Helium's IoT network enables the use of Zero Knowledge Proofs via w3bstream. Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) is a privacy-preserving cryptographic protocol that enables users to prove the validity of their data without revealing the data itself. This enhances the privacy and security of Maxwell's data, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential.
### Hardware Features and Standards

Maxwell is designed to work with AC inputs with 50-60 Hz / 100-240V, making it compatible with both European and US grid standards. The device firmware runs on 2 microcontroller variants, an STM32G4A1KE variant, and an ATMEGA328 variant with minor price differences. The meters can also come with AC relays for remotely controlling metered load, a 16MHz quartz crystal oscillator 16MHz for keeping time, and only runs on about 0.025 W of power.
### Conclusion

In conclusion, Maxwell is an advanced smart meter that combines real-time sensor data with web3 technologies to provide complex metering services in decentralized energy systems. With its ability to collect over 3,600 data points per minute and its compatibility with both European and US grid standards, Maxwell is an ideal solution for remote or hard-to-reach locations.
